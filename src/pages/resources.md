# Introduction

Learning about Zero knowledge security entails that you have a solid understanding of the maths that make up zero knowledge proofs in the first place. This section covers all the publicly available resources one could consider to level up their ZK skills.

      <p>This ZK Books starts from the very beginning and covers everything that is required to understand the Groth16 proving algorithm. It covers the following topics (in details) with ample examples: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explaining what is a Set, Group, Ring and Field </li>
        <li>Elliptic Curve Addition and Multiplication (Bilinear Pairings) </li>
        <li>What are ZK Circuits? </li>
        <li>Representing ZK Circuits as R1CS and creating ZK Proofs with R1CS</li>
        <li>Converting R1CS to QAP for succintness via Schwartz-Zippel</li>
        <li>QAP evaluation over Elliptic Curve</li>
        <li>Groth16 end-to-end explanation</li>
        <li>Intro to Circom and Circomlib</li>
      </ul>
