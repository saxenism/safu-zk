# ZK Concepts

## Fiat Shamir

1. Everyone just sort of assumes that you already know what FS is, however, most people don't or atleast they have nothing beyond a superficial idea of how FS works in depth.

  + Copying a tweet I posted about this resource:

  + *If you'd ever wanted to move beyond understanding WHAT is Fiat Shamir and know how and why it is secure... please watch this presentation by @ronrothblum: https://youtube.com/watch?v=9cagVtYstyY*

  + *Security is basically ensuring:*

    + *1. Completeness*
    + *2. Soundness*
    + *3. Preserving ZK (over n rounds)*

  + *This presentation will help you understand why FS is secure for an ideal hash function, ie, the ROM (Random Oracle Model).*

  + *And most importantly, why people make mistakes while implementing FS, because FS does not have such strong guarentees over real, concrete hash families. And, if you can internalise why, I reckon that would be a good spot to go bug-hunting.*
